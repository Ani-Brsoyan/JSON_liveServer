## README
NOTE: Before using this progam, make sure you have installed python flask package.

The purpose of this program is to take json format data from data.json and create an HTML table. server.py is a server, that provides data from data.json to index.html. 
Ajax js is used to make program more dynamic.

If Flask is installed within a virtual environment (venv) you have to run **source /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/activate** on you terminal before running the server (server.py).
After running server.py visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the output.

Happy coding!
