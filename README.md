## README
NOTE: Before you use this program, please make sure you have installed the python flask package.

This program aims to take JSON format data from *.json files located in the given directory (server.py:9) and create an HTML table. server.py is a server, that provides desirable data to index.html. 
Ajax js is used to make the program more dynamic.

If Flask is installed within a virtual environment (venv) you have to run **source /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/activate** on your terminal before running the server (server.py).
After running server.py visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the output.

Happy coding!
